    <h1>Introduction to Cloud Computing</h1>
    <p>Cloud computing is a technology that enables users to access and use computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics over the internet (the "cloud"). Instead of relying on local servers or personal devices for processing and storing data, cloud computing allows individuals and organizations to use powerful, scalable resources hosted remotely. Cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform offer these resources on a pay-as-you-go model, providing flexibility and reducing upfront infrastructure costs.</p>
    
    <h2>Benefits of Cloud Computing:</h2>
    <p><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong>Cloud computing reduces the need for large upfront investments in hardware, software, and on-site infrastructure. Users only pay for the resources they use, allowing businesses to manage their expenses more effectively.</p>
    <p><strong>Scalability:</strong>Cloud services are highly scalable, allowing users to increase or decrease their resource use depending on their needs. This flexibility ensures that businesses can quickly respond to changes in demand.</p>
    <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong>Cloud computing enables access to data and applications from anywhere, as long as there is an internet connection. This improves collaboration and productivity, especially in remote or distributed teams.</p>
    <p><strong>Reliability:</strong> Cloud providers often have multiple data centers and backup systems, ensuring high availability and minimizing downtime.</p>
    <p><strong>Security:</strong> Major cloud providers offer robust security measures such as encryption and identity management.</p>
    <p><strong>Automatic Updates:</strong> Cloud providers handle software updates and routine maintenance, freeing businesses from the burden of maintaining IT infrastructure.</p>
    
    <h2>Models of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <p>There are three main models:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>IaaS:</strong> Infrastructure as a Service (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines)</li>
        <li><strong>PaaS:</strong> Platform as a Service (e.g., Azure App Services, Google App Engine)</li>
        <li><strong>SaaS:</strong> Software as a Service (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The Evolution of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <p>Cloud computing has evolved from early time-sharing models in the 1950s to modern multi-cloud and edge computing solutions in the 2020s. Today, serverless computing and cloud-native technologies are driving new innovations.</p>
